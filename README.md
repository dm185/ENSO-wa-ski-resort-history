# ENSO Washington State Ski Resort Snowfall/Snowpack History
### Analyzing historical snowfall and snowpack data to help uncover useful insights for future ski resort planning 

#### With increasing global sea-surface temperatures, ski resorts may be looking as to the feasibility of expanding winter resort operations. The goal of this project is to ansnwer the following questions:
* Have snowfall/snowpack trends been decreasing since the early 1970s and if so, are the decreases signifant?
* How might El Niño-Southern Oscillation ("ENSO") winter/sprint weather patterns be affecting winter snowfall/snowpack?
* Have certain ENSO winter patterns been increasing over the years?
* Might there be any correlations to storm weather patterns in the Atlantic that might correlate to the future winter/spring season?
* How have rising sea-surface temperatuers been potentially impacting snowfall/snowpack amounts?


#### Delivering insights from answering this questions may serve the following purposes:
* Will expanding winter resort operations be more feasible in certain areas and not others?
* How might knowing if a winter/spring is going to be an El Niño or La Niña affect resort budgeting?
  * Might resorts prefer to expand winter operations if a good winter is predicted the following winter or expand on summer operations if a not so good winter is forecasted?
* Resorts would use the information and insights to better plan resort expansion operations. This might also impact decision making on using artificial snow making. Other agencies can also use these insights to see how a decrease in snowfall/snowpack amounts might affect sprint water runoff and how this might contribute to ecological changes and how these changes may affect wildlife.
